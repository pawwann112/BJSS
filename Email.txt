**Subject:** Assistance Required: Enabling Drive Security with Hardware Encryption on Cisco UCS C2200 M6  

Dear Cisco Support Team,  

I hope this email finds you well.  

I am currently working on configuring drive security with hardware encryption on a Cisco UCS C2200 M6 server. I would appreciate your guidance on the following:  
1. **Documentation:** Could you provide specific documentation or a step-by-step guide for enabling hardware encryption using Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) on this model?  
2. **Hardware Requirements:** What are the exact hardware requirements, such as compatible drives and RAID controllers, for this setup?  
3. **Configuration Support:** Are there any best practices or key considerations while configuring encryption and managing keys via Cisco IMC or other tools?  

If there are additional tools, software, or licenses needed to enable this feature, kindly share the details.  

Your assistance will be invaluable in ensuring the security configuration is implemented effectively. Please let me know if you need more details regarding my current setup.  

Looking forward to your response.
